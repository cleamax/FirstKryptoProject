# SecureToken and NFT Marketplace Test Project

## Overview

This repository contains a test project that demonstrates the development of smart contracts for an ERC20 token and an NFT marketplace. The project is for **testing purposes only** and has **not been deployed on the mainnet**. All necessary smart contracts are included in the `contracts/` directory.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Programming language for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **OpenZeppelin**: Library of smart contracts for security and standardization.
- **Remix IDE**: Online IDE for developing and testing smart contracts.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used for developing backend services.
- **npm**: Package manager for JavaScript to manage dependencies.

## Contents

- **SecureToken**: An ERC20 token with minting and burning functionalities.
  - **Burn Function**: Users can burn their tokens to reduce the total supply.

- **Bug Bounty Program**: A separate smart contract that allows the submission of bugs and rewards for discovering security vulnerabilities.

- **MyNFT**: An ERC721 NFT contract that enables minting NFTs.
  - **Mint Function**: The owner of the contract can mint NFTs to different addresses.

- **Marketplace**: A smart contract that facilitates the buying and selling of NFTs.

## Skills and Knowledge

Through working on this project, I have acquired the following skills and knowledge:

- **Smart Contract Development**: Understanding the fundamentals of smart contracts and their implementation in Solidity.
- **Token Standards**: Knowledge of ERC20 and ERC721 standards and their application.
- **Smart Contract Security**: Awareness of security aspects and the necessity of bug bounty programs.
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Ability to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and test networks.
- **Using OpenZeppelin**: Experience in utilizing OpenZeppelin libraries to ensure standards and security.
- **Remix IDE**: Ability to use Remix for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.


## Notes

- **No Launch on Mainnet**: This project is intended solely for development and testing purposes.
- **Security**: Please be aware that the smart contracts have not been tested for security or performance. Do not use them in production.
